# A Framework for the Coordination of Wake Steering Strategies


## Introduction

This repository contains a Simulink-based framework designed for the execution, monitoring, and coordination of wake steering strategies on a wind turbine. The models contained in this repository are inspired by those developed by the Lehrstuhl für Windenergie at the Technische Universität München and the ForWind - Center for Wind Energy Research at the University of Oldenburg, as part of the federally-funded German project CompactWindII. This framework is a submodel of PAL, a more general framework for the deployment of interconnected applications on PLC systems.
